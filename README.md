# Undergraduate-Applied-Econometrics-Project
This was my final project for the third-year Applied Econometrics (EC303) Project at the University of Reading. The project was based on the annual Understanding Society â€“ The UK Household Longitudinal Study dataset and explored the effect of smoking on wages using various Regression Models.
